This is for running **nvGraph** functions right from the CLI with graphs in
MatrixMarket format (.mtx) directly. It just needs a x86_64 linux machine
with NVIDIA GPU drivers installed. Execution time, along with the results
can be saved in JSON/YAML file. The [packaging code] is written in Node.js.
You can install this with `npm install -g nvgraph.sh`.
